A Lawyer had a PDF file where he had the details of his clients like name, phone number, address , dob, dom ect. but all the data was really unlabelled and very badly arranged which was really challenging task.

The lawyer wanted to basically wanted name and phone number in excel file , there were total 6190 numbers of entries in the pdf file. but the Lawyer was doing everything manually and it would have took him almost 2 months to do it manually and he wanted it to be done in a single day

So i helped my Lawyer friend by using some good data science and data analytics brain and used PY2PDF lib. you can see the entire steps below. PS the work was done in just single day. and it was really good project to deal with
